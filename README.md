# ModularCalculator

Modular Calculator created for 2017 bitwise hackathon. 

Currently abandoned mid-development. Ideally a fully programmable modular calculator that can be used to automate complicated calculations both via internal input streams and external analog sources.
From a physical perspective, consider it like programmable python mixed with LabVIEW.

Currently it should support simple user definable operands, very hesitantly should be able to nest and implicitly call between user defined functions. 

To Do:
- Design/Build/Implement front-end layer. 
    - Design: Want to mimic a design similar to how the google suit of apps works. A single dashboard and a store where you can find programs to download, add to dashboard, all run from a central location. 
    - Build: Front-End Architecture TBD
    - Implement: Front-End Interface TBD
    
- Finish designing test cases and final goals of project to further guide development of tasks.
